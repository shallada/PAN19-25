## PAN19-25

This is a pre-processed version of the PAN19 dataset.
Read about it [here](https://pan.webis.de/clef19/pan19-web/author-profiling.html)

We built the data set by combining 4 instances to a sample.
There are five samples per author and 25 authors for a total of 125 samples (500 instances).
The dataset consists of 9 bot samples, 8 male and 8 female samples, although our work didn't require these identifications, so they have been dropped from this data.
See CreateFiles.py for details on the creation of the samples.

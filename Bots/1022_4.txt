we drowned this morningand shut.how delicately-#poetry
never guess mouthson the sills and panesyou walked away ...-#poetry
and knows his scabby headwhatever tried to countafter awhile,-#poetry
and call it terra incognita,in his ass, pumping seeds from his mouthor june with a tuft of net-#poetry
like a sea horse,beginning to run on the beachindeed, we ceased to believe in it.-#poetry
i don't know anything anymore.bending to die in the dunes.in the bush-#poetry
of wonder!umbrella gets openedlike this little tiger lily,-#poetry
for uraniansas it takes to seed.when words fail you?-#poetry
the connecting valleyfrom half of a walnut, a flyin the swelling air.-#poetry
in the grass?lit from within and the flyfor the feet.-#poetry
and time, that hourly girl,some say i've entrusted my destinybut looking for something to bring back-#poetry
never guess mouthswhat wild black eyesbecomes a small voice-#poetry
even the colt's footchattering to one another that one daythat i think language must be new,-#poetry
a lamb is sacrificedthough a few may rouse from their drowsinessand still an untouched ladder-#poetry
boys, girls, say sincerelythe birth of a boy is to be watched.and one of them leans-#poetry
my husband is happy as a poetmore hopelessly than in the first dreamthe rains come,-#poetry
segmented like blackberries.i can see them there: they haveon a bottle of wine.-#poetry
a sky newborn and wet like a dark red calfthem one by oneor june with a tuft of net-#poetry
full flush in the goldenrodon sunday eveningsand sing, their hair falling into pleats-#poetry
like a peacock's tail, his sirenby the time they reach that horsechoking a nest:-#poetry
